= Automatic Scheduling =

A new service from Soflyy, Automatic Scheduling provides a simple interface for setting exports to run on a schedule. The service will make sure that your exports start on time and that they successfully complete without the need to set up individual cron jobs. 

It costs $9/mo and can be used with WP All Export and WP All Import. You can set up as many exports and imports on as many sites as you like.

**What information is shared with Soflyy?** If you set an export to run on a schedule, WP All Export will open an encrypted connection to Soflyy servers. It will send the license key, site URL, ID of the export you want to run, export security key, and times that you want the export to run.

= Export Users to CSV =

A CSV is a very simple spreadsheet file. Essentially, it's just a text file where commas are used to separate each column. With WP All Export you can very easily set up a WordPress user CSV export and control the order and title of the columns.

Very often you'll want to edit your WordPress users with Microsoft Excel, Numbers, Google Sheets, or maybe something else. This is why a CSV user export is so powerfule - every piece of spreadsheet software out there can work with CSV files, even basic text editors. WP All Export allows you edit your WordPress user data using whatever spreadsheet software you like.

= Export Users to XML =

Sometimes you'll want to export your WordPress user data so that some other software, service, or tool can use it. They will usually require your data to be formatted as an XML file, which looks a lot like HTML. But don't worry, with WP All Export you don't need to know anything about all that to set up an XML user export.

With WP All Export you simply drag and drop to create your custom user export XML file. You don't need to write any code, just drag and drop. But don't worry, if you do know how to write XML and have some specific requirements, instead of drag and drop you can write up a custom XML export and insert your WordPress user data wherever it needs to go in your XML feed.
